  *SP

  Prevent the main grid reloading after each transaction write (during bank import)

  30/07/2015 - SP - Modification - MainUnit.pas -

  *James Walsh (7919)/GL/MK
  Show the bank name on the main grid if the transaction type is 6 which is a Purchase payment.

  30/07/2015 - SP - Bug Fix - NewListing.pas -

  *Elizabeth McKean (6397)/MK
  Problem observed when adding a new account using the NewListing unit, the
  AccsDataModule.Accounts data needs to be refreshed to reflect any changes
  to the accounts.

  Refresh all accounts if record has been added. (AccsDataModule.Accounts.Refresh;)

  29/07/2015 - SP - Modification - uBankImport.pas -

  Prior to posting the banklink transaction, we are now checking if the description field
  is empty and if so we are now defaulting the description to the nominal account name.

  *Elizabeth McKean (6397) uncovered this problem where transactions were being saved with a blank
  description and she couldn't identify what nominal account was specified
  for the transaction when viewing from the main screen.

  29/07/2015 - SP - Bug Fix - uSupplierDownload.pas -

  For backwards compatibility we need to store the EntCode as
  part of the purchase invoice transaction so that the cashbook screen
  ent code column can be populated during editing.

  *James Walsh (7919) reported this to MK/GL.



[V4.2 R1.0] -

  28/07/2015 - SP - Modification - uBankImport.pas -

  During an import of an Ulster Bank file for Joe & Elizabeth McKean 6397
  we came across a problem where the debit amount was actually prefixed
  with a negative symbol. The program was expecting a positive amount.
  To counteract this, we need to convert the negative amount to positive.

                              for the simple entry system.

               SP - Bug Fix   A problem became apparent when the grid column layout changed due to new preference options.
                              If the cPref_AutoEntSelect is set to true the Enterprise column will appear after the Nominal column.
                              If this happens we should not recall the default enterprise code as it will have been preset (where applicable)
                              via the Nominal selection.
